# Digital Wallet

 This application is going to be a web app, which simulates main functions of online wallets like Skrill, PayPal, Neteller etc.
 ###### Planned behaviour of the app is to: 
- create an account
- transfer money between users using just email address
- deposit/withdraw money
- manage profile (change password etc.)
- show and filter history of transactions
- simple dashboard with charts
